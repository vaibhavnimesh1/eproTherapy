              It’s as if each person who works with a therapist is adding stones
              to a Cairn.
            </h6>
            <p>
              Their challenges and efforts are collected and then stacked up to
              help you navigate your path forward. It is for this reason the
              Cairn in our logo represents not only your therapist but everyone
              who has contributed their story to the history of the path you are
              on.
            </p>

            {" "}
            <h6 className="head ">
              This means that when you work with a therapist you are indirectly
              working with travelers before you AND that you can leave a legacy
              to help those who come next.
            </h6>
            <p>
              You will help to build up the Cairn. In this way our experiences
              and stories pass on and connect us through time - each traveler
              helping to show the way for others. It’s really beautiful when you
              think about it.
            </p>

              We hope your journey is going well and continues on that way.
            </h6>
            <p>
              If you are facing rocky terrain then we invite you to benefit from
              the Cairn of experience of those who went before you and the
              expertise of the professional licensed therapists who were
              privileged to take a few steps along with them.
