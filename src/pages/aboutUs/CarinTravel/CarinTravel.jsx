            Cairns are particularly useful over rocky terrain where it can be
            difficult to see a well-worn path on the ground.

          <p>
            They stand out to inform new travelers that someone has taken that
            path before and left a landmark to show the way. The Cairn is a
            guide for life’s journey and that is why it features prominently in
            our logo.

            Life really does seem to cross over difficult terrain.

            Sometimes it can be nearly impossible to see the way forward. It’s
            no exaggeration to say that a professional licensed therapist can be
            a helpful guide but it may not be entirely apparent why at first.

            Yes, they have a formal education and have successfully passed
            licensing processes but that isn’t the most important thing they can
            offer.
