            The word Cairn comes from Scottish Gaelic and means “stack of
            stones”.
          </h6>
          <p>
            Cairns date back for thousands of years throughout many different
            cultures and societies all over the world.

          </p>
          <p>
            It’s certainly not a stretch of the imagination to assume that
            Cairns predate recorded history - that as soon as humanity emerged
            people started stacking stones in conspicuous places as landmarks,
            monuments, and memorials.
